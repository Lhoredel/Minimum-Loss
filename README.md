# Minimum-Loss
This code solves the Minimum Loss problem by finding the smallest possible loss when buying and selling a house over time with price constraints. It pairs prices with their original indices, sorts in descending price order, then checks adjacent pairs to find valid transactions where buying occurs before selling. The algorithm tracks the minimum positive price difference that satisfies the temporal constraint of purchasing before selling in the original sequence.
